title: "The Tests You're Afraid to Refactor"
---

You've been on this project. Unit tests, API tests, E2E suite. The unit test checks the calculation. The API test checks the status code. The E2E test checks that the page renders. Each one tested a slice of the behavior at one level. Nobody tested the whole behavior at any level. A customer hits the gap before you do.

The domain is smeared across all of them. A validation here, a default there, an assertion about a JSON shape somewhere else. No single test can tell you whether the feature actually works. You just have a patchwork and you assume it adds up.

And the tests are coupled to whatever seam was convenient at the time. The unit test is wired to a database call. The Playwright test is coupled to CSS selectors. None of them are coupled to what the system actually does. They're coupled to how it's built right now. So when you refactor, the tests break. Not because the behavior changed, but because the seams moved.

That's the test suite you're afraid to refactor.

## One behavior, one place

```bash
npm install --save-dev @averspec/core vitest
npx aver init
```

Three files.

## The domain

A contract for what the system does. Nothing about how.

```typescript
import { defineDomain, action, query, assertion } from '@averspec/core'

export const taskBoard = defineDomain({
  name: 'task-board',
  actions: {
    createTask: action<{ title: string }>(),
    moveTask:   action<{ title: string; status: string }>(),
    deleteTask: action<{ title: string }>(),
  },
  queries: {
    taskDetails: query<{ title: string }, Task | undefined>(),
  },
  assertions: {
    taskInStatus: assertion<{ title: string; status: string }>(),
    taskCount:    assertion<{ status: string; count: number }>(),
  },
})
```

## The adapter

Maps the domain to real code:

```typescript
import { implement, unit } from '@averspec/core'
import { Board } from '../src/board.js'
import { taskBoard } from '../domains/task-board.js'

export const unitAdapter = implement(taskBoard, {
  protocol: unit(() => new Board()),

  actions: {
    createTask: async (board, { title }) => board.create(title),
    moveTask:   async (board, { title, status }) => board.move(title, status),
    deleteTask: async (board, { title }) => board.delete(title),
  },

  queries: {
    taskDetails: async (board, { title }) => board.details(title),
  },

  assertions: {
    taskInStatus: async (board, { title, status }) => {
      expect(board.details(title)?.status).toBe(status)
    },
    taskCount: async (board, { status, count }) => {
      expect(board.byStatus(status)).toHaveLength(count)
    },
  },
})
```

Every domain operation gets a handler. Miss one and it won't compile.

## The test

Speaks only domain language:

```typescript
import { suite } from '@averspec/core'
import { taskBoard } from '../domains/task-board.js'

const { test } = suite(taskBoard)

test('create a task in backlog', async ({ when, then }) => {
  await when.createTask({ title: 'Fix login bug' })
  await then.taskInStatus({ title: 'Fix login bug', status: 'backlog' })
  await then.taskCount({ status: 'backlog', count: 1 })
})

test('move task through workflow', async ({ given, when, then }) => {
  await given.createTask({ title: 'Fix login bug' })
  await when.moveTask({ title: 'Fix login bug', status: 'in-progress' })
  await then.taskInStatus({ title: 'Fix login bug', status: 'in-progress' })
  await then.taskCount({ status: 'backlog', count: 0 })
})
```

No selectors. No HTTP calls. No `new Board()`. The test doesn't know what's underneath it.

```bash
npx aver run
```

```
 ✓ create a task in backlog [unit]          1ms
 ✓ move task through workflow [unit]        1ms
```

## Add a second adapter

Say you have an Express API:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @averspec/protocol-http
```

```typescript
export const httpAdapter = implement(taskBoard, {
  protocol: http({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000' }),

  actions: {
    createTask: async (ctx, { title }) => {
      const res = await ctx.post('/api/tasks', { title })
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`${res.status}`)
    },
    // ...same shape, different protocol
  },

  // queries, assertions...
})
```

Register both adapters in `aver.config.ts`. Run again. Same tests, didn't touch them:

```
 ✓ create a task in backlog [unit]          1ms
 ✓ create a task in backlog [http]         48ms
 ✓ move task through workflow [unit]        1ms
 ✓ move task through workflow [http]       11ms
```

## When things disagree

Say someone changes the API so that creating a task defaults to `"todo"` instead of `"backlog"`. The unit adapter still passes. The HTTP adapter fails:

```
 ✓ create a task in backlog [unit]          1ms
 ✗ create a task in backlog [http]         52ms
   → expected "backlog" but got "todo"
```

That's a real bug at a real boundary. The domain says tasks start in backlog. The API disagrees. Without the shared contract, you'd find this in production or not at all, because the unit test and the API test would each use their own vocabulary and both would pass.

Change the behavior in one place. The tests tell you everywhere it breaks.
